# Vibe Marketing & Coding: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

_Last updated: 2025-07-15 (Final Strategy Polish)_

## 1. Overview

**Purpose:**  
To establish the "Vibe Marketing & Coding" agency as the definitive resource for building beautiful, user-centric applications and authentic brands. Our unique selling proposition is the fusion of **Vibe Coding** (mastery of the Cursor + Claude environment for rapid, high-quality development) and **Vibe Marketing** (building brands people love through authentic content and community).

**Scope:**  
Deliver a comprehensive ecosystem that teaches and implements our dual philosophy:
- **Services:** Build bespoke, full-stack applications and automated marketing engines for clients.
- **Digital Products:** Offer a suite of courses, templates, and toolkits covering both our development workflow and our authentic marketing strategies.
- **Community:** Cultivate a community of forward-thinking builders who value both exceptional engineering and authentic brand-building.
- **Content:** Become the #1 authority on YouTube and X/Twitter for AI-assisted development and authentic marketing for tech-enabled creators.

## 2. Objectives & Success Criteria

- **Revenue:** $50K+ MRR within 12 months.
- **Community:** 10,000+ active members, with a 5% conversion rate to paid products.
- **Product:** Launch a flagship course "The Vibe Coding Masterclass" and a parallel "Vibe Marketing Launchpad" course.
- **Brand:** Be synonymous with the "Cursor + Claude" development workflow and the "Vibe Marketing" philosophy. Rank #1 for keywords like "build UI for n8n," "Supabase tutorial," "Vibe Coding," and "buildshipmarket alternative."

## 3. Target Users

### Personas

1.  **The Ambitious Automator:**
    *   **Pain:** Has mastered n8n/Zapier but their deliverables are "just workflows." They can't command premium prices because the client experience is clunky and lacks a professional UI.
    *   **Goal:** To level-up their skills, offer polished, dashboard-driven solutions, and transition from freelancer to product builder.
2.  **The Solopreneur Developer:**
    *   **Pain:** Wants to build and ship SaaS ideas quickly but gets bogged down in boilerplate code, complex setups, and slow development cycles.
    *   **Goal:** To leverage the "cheat code" of Cursor + Claude to rapidly prototype, build, and launch multiple SaaS products.
3.  **The Agency Owner:**
    *   **Pain:** Their agency's automation services are becoming commoditized. They need a new, high-value offering to stand out.
    *   **Goal:** To integrate a "Vibe Coding" division into their agency, offering custom front-ends and dashboards as a premium service.
4.  **The Creative Founder:**
    *   **Pain:** Has a strong brand vision and a loyal community but struggles to translate that into scalable digital products and automated marketing funnels.
    *   **Goal:** To partner with an agency that understands their "vibe" and can build the technical infrastructure to support their growth without sacrificing authenticity.

## 8. Go-To-Market Strategy

- [ ] **Founding Members Launch:** Offer a lifetime deal on "The Vibe Academy" for the first 50-100 members. This will create initial buzz, secure early revenue, and build a core group of advocates.
- [ ] **Partnership-Led Promotion:** Collaborate with 1-2 key influencers in the Supabase, n8n, or AI development communities for a joint webinar or content swap during launch week to tap into existing audiences.
- [ ] **Build in Public:** Document the entire journey of building "Vibe Marketing & Coding" on X/Twitter and YouTube—sharing revenue, challenges, and lessons to build authenticity and a loyal following.

## 9. MVP Scope

- [ ] Launch free Skool community with onboarding flow and defined community rituals.
- [ ] Release 5–10 workflow templates (Notion, n8n, Claude)
- [ ] Publish 3–5 YouTube tutorials & 10 Twitter threads documenting the "Build in Public" journey.
- [ ] Announce and promote the "Founding Members" offer for the Vibe Academy.
- [ ] Build landing page (Webflow) with lead magnets and a clear call-to-action for the Founding Members offer.

## 10. Success Metrics

- **Launch:** Secure 50+ Founding Members within the first month.
- **MRR:** $10K+ within 3 months, $50K+ in 12 months
- **Community:** 1,000+ members in 3 months, 10,000+ in 12 months
- **Course Completions:** 100+ in 6 months
- **YouTube:** 5,000+ subs in 6 months, 20,000+ in 12 months
- **Twitter:** 10,000+ followers in 6 months

## 11. Risks & Mitigation

- **Platform Risk:** Diversify community presence across Skool, email lists, and social platforms to avoid single-point-of-failure.
- **AI Model Changes:** Build an abstraction layer for core AI calls to easily swap models (Claude, GPT, etc.) if performance or pricing changes.
- **Market Saturation:** Differentiate aggressively on the unique "Vibe Coding" philosophy and the tight-knit, high-engagement community model.
- **Key Person Risk:** The brand is initially tied to the founder. **Mitigation:** Document all processes and methodologies from day one. Long-term goal is to train other coaches in the "Vibe Coding" method to create a scalable agency and reduce dependency.
- **Pacing & Burnout Risk:** The timeline is ambitious for a solo founder. **Mitigation:** Prioritize revenue-generating activities first. The **Vibe Cohort** is the highest priority as it generates immediate high-ticket cash flow, and its content can be recorded and repurposed for the self-paced Vibe Academy, creating a more sustainable development pace.
