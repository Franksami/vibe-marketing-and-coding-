# Task ID: 41
# Title: Implement AI-Powered Vibe Command Menu Assistant
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 22, 23, 30
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a floating AI assistant button that appears on all pages, with contextual awareness for the /rules route and three predefined action options: "Show code snippet", "Generate Claude prompts", and "Discuss in Community".
# Details:
1. Create new React component 'VibeCommandMenu':
   - Implement floating button using fixed positioning
   - Add click handler to toggle command menu overlay
   - Style using Tailwind CSS for consistent design
   - Ensure proper z-index handling

2. Integrate with Next.js layout:
   - Add component to root layout.js
   - Implement route detection logic using Next.js router
   - Handle mobile responsiveness
   - Manage component mounting/unmounting

3. Implement context awareness:
   - Create route detection hook for /rules path
   - Implement context provider for global state
   - Define action handlers for each command:
     * Show code snippet: Display relevant code based on current page
     * Generate Claude prompts: Interface with AI prompt generation
     * Discuss in Community: Link to community discussion

4. Style and Animation:
   - Add subtle entrance/exit animations
   - Implement hover states and transitions
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Add keyboard navigation support

5. Performance Considerations:
   - Lazy load command menu content
   - Implement debouncing for route detection
   - Optimize render performance
   - Handle edge cases and error states

Technical Requirements:
- Use React 18+ features
- Implement with TypeScript
- Follow atomic design principles
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design

# Test Strategy:
1. Component Testing:
   - Unit test React component rendering
   - Verify button positioning and visibility
   - Test menu toggle functionality
   - Validate context awareness logic
   - Check mobile responsiveness

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify Next.js layout integration
   - Test route detection accuracy
   - Validate command menu actions
   - Check state management
   - Test keyboard navigation

3. User Experience Testing:
   - Verify animations and transitions
   - Test accessibility compliance
   - Validate mobile touch interactions
   - Check screen reader compatibility

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure component load time
   - Test memory usage
   - Verify lazy loading
   - Check render performance

5. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Verify mobile browser compatibility
   - Check different viewport sizes
   - Validate touch interactions
