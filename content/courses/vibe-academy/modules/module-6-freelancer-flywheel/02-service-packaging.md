# Lesson 2: Service Packaging & Pricing - Turn Skills into Revenue

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Master the psychology of value-based pricing
- Create three irresistible service packages
- Build a pricing strategy that scales with your expertise
- Implement scope protection and upselling techniques

## 💸 The Money Mindset Shift

**Stop Selling Time. Start Selling Transformation.**

Most freelancers fail because they think like employees:
- ❌ "I charge $50/hour for AI development"
- ✅ "I charge $2,497 to automate your customer service"

The difference? One sells inputs (time), the other sells outcomes (results).

## 💰 Pricing Strategy Mastery

### The 10x Value Rule
Your price should be 1/10th of the value you create:
- Save client 20 hours/month @ $50/hour = $1,000/month value
- Your price: $100-200/month retainer

### Psychology Pricing Tactics

#### 1. Charm Pricing
- $297 instead of $300
- $1,497 instead of $1,500
- $4,997 instead of $5,000

#### 2. Anchor High
Always show your premium package first:
- Premium: $4,997 ⬅ (anchor)
- Standard: $1,997 (seems reasonable)
- Basic: $497 (bargain)

#### 3. Bundle Value
Don't list features, stack value:
- Custom AI Assistant ($2,000 value)
- ➕ Team Training ($500 value)
- ➕ 30-Day Support ($500 value)
- ➕ Monthly Optimization ($300 value)
- = Total Value: $3,300
