## 📝 Proposal Writing Masterclass

### The Psychology of Winning Proposals

#### Opening Lines That Hook

❌ Generic: "I read your job post and I'm interested..."

✅ Specific Examples:
- "Your Shopify store's 68% cart abandonment rate is costing you $50K+/month. Here's how I'll fix it..."
- "I see you're manually processing 200+ customer inquiries daily. I can automate 80% of that by Friday..."
- "Your competitor is using AI to handle support 24/7. Here's how to leapfrog them..."

#### The 3-Part Value Proposition

1. **Acknowledge** their specific problem
2. **Agitate** by showing the cost of inaction  
3. **Solve** with your specific approach

Example:
"I see you're spending 3 hours daily on repetitive email responses (acknowledge). That's 15 hours/week you could spend growing your business (agitate). My AI email assistant will handle 90% of these automatically while maintaining your brand voice (solve)."

### Platform-Specific Proposal Tips

- Include video introduction link
