Subject: [Specific Problem] at [Company] - Quick Fix Attached

Hi [First Name],

[HOOK - Ultra-specific observation]
I noticed [Company]'s checkout process has 7 steps, which might explain the 68% cart abandonment rate mentioned in your recent investor update.

I recorded a 2-minute Loom showing how Company could reduce this to 3 steps using AI-powered form filling. Here's the link: [link]

[CREDIBILITY - Brief and relevant]
I recently helped [Similar Company] reduce their abandonment rate by 41% using a similar approach.

[SOFT CTA - Low commitment]
