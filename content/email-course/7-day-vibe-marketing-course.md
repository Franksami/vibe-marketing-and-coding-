## Day 1: Your Marketing Foundation
**Subject**: The $10k/mo developer who hates marketing (Day 1)
**Send**: 24 hours after Day 0

Hi [First Name],

Meet Sarah. She's a developer making $10k/mo from her SaaS.

She HATES marketing.

Yet her product grew from 0 to 200 customers in 6 months. How?

She built a marketing foundation that works on autopilot:

**The 3-Pillar Foundation:**

1. **One Clear Message** (you did this yesterday!)
2. **One Content Channel** (pick ONE to start)
3. **One Conversion Path** (how people become customers)

Sarah's setup:
- Message: "I help agencies automate client reporting"
- Channel: LinkedIn (where her customers are)
- Path: Free tool → Email list → Paid product

**Your Exercise Today:**
Pick YOUR one channel:
- Twitter/X: Good for developers, quick feedback
- LinkedIn: B2B focused, higher quality leads
- YouTube: Long-form, builds deep trust
- Blog: SEO benefits, showcases expertise

Don't overthink it. You can always change later.

Which channel feels most natural to you?

Tomorrow: How to find your authentic voice (hint: you already have it).

## Day 2: Finding Your Vibe
**Subject**: Why "just be yourself" is terrible advice (Day 2)
**Send**: 24 hours after Day 1

Hi [First Name],

"Just be yourself!"

Worst. Marketing. Advice. Ever.

Which "self" exactly? The one debugging at 2am? The one in client meetings? The one teaching your junior dev?

Here's better advice: **Be your most helpful self.**

I call this your "Teaching Voice" - the one you use when helping someone solve a problem you've already figured out.

**Finding Your Teaching Voice:**

Think about the last time you helped someone with code. Notice how you:
- Broke down complex concepts
- Used specific examples
- Shared what worked (and what didn't)
- Never talked down to them

THAT'S your marketing voice.

**Your Exercise:**
Write about one thing you learned this week:
1. What problem did you solve?
2. What did you try first? (that didn't work)
3. What actually worked?
4. What would you tell past you?

Keep it under 200 words. No jargon. Write like you're helping a friend.

This is exactly how I write all my content. It's just teaching at scale.

Tomorrow: The content formula that got me 10k followers.

## Day 3: Content That Connects
**Subject**: The 3-part formula I use for every post (Day 3)
**Send**: 24 hours after Day 2

Hi [First Name],

Every viral post I've written follows this formula:

**Hook → Value → Action**

Let me break it down with a real example that got 50k views:

**HOOK** (stop the scroll):
"I wasted $5k on Facebook ads. Here's what actually worked instead:"

**VALUE** (deliver on promise):
- Shared exact ad spend breakdown
- Showed what failed and why
- Revealed the organic strategy that worked
- Included specific metrics

**ACTION** (what's next):
"What's your biggest marketing fail? Let's learn together 👇"

**Why this works:**
- Hook: Creates curiosity gap
- Value: Builds trust by delivering
- Action: Starts conversations

**Your Exercise:**
Write one post using this formula:

Hook ideas:
- "I spent [time] building [thing]. Here's what I learned:"
- "Everyone says [common advice]. Here's why they're wrong:"
- "[Number] [tool] features nobody talks about:"

Remember: The best hooks come from your actual experience.

Share your post draft by replying to this email!

Tomorrow: How to build in public without oversharing.

## Day 4: Building in Public
**Subject**: Share your journey, not your journal (Day 4)
**Send**: 24 hours after Day 3

Hi [First Name],

There's a fine line between building in public and oversharing.

❌ Oversharing: "Feeling overwhelmed today. Might give up. 😔"
✅ Building in public: "Hit a wall with authentication. Here's how I'm solving it:"

See the difference?

One seeks sympathy. The other provides value.

**The SHOW Framework for Building in Public:**

**S**pecific milestone or challenge
**H**ow you're approaching it
**O**utcome or lesson learned
**W**hat's next

**Example:**
"Spent 3 hours debugging a memory leak in our Node app.

Tried:
- Increasing heap size (didn't work)
- Profiling with Chrome DevTools (found the issue)
- Weak references for cache (fixed it!)

Lesson: Always profile before optimizing.

Next: Writing a guide on Node memory management"

**Your Exercise:**
Share one thing from your current project:
1. What are you building?
2. What challenge are you facing?
3. How are you solving it?
4. What's the next step?

Post this today. Tag me if you're on Twitter/LinkedIn!

Tomorrow: Automation that doesn't feel robotic.

## Day 5: Automation Secrets
**Subject**: How I create content in 2 hours/week (Day 5)
**Send**: 24 hours after Day 4

Hi [First Name],

True story: I spend 2 hours per week on marketing.

That's it.

Here's my exact automation setup:

**Content Creation (30 mins):**
- Batch write 5 posts every Monday
- Use templates for consistency
- Repurpose across platforms

**Scheduling (15 mins):**
- Buffer for social posts
- ConvertKit for emails
- Gumroad for product updates

**Engagement (45 mins):**
- Reply to comments/DMs
- Share others' content
- Quick community check-ins

**My Secret Weapon: The Content Matrix**

I have 7 content types I rotate:
1. Tutorial (Monday)
2. Tool tip (Tuesday)
3. Mistake/lesson (Wednesday)
4. Resource share (Thursday)
5. Community win (Friday)
6. Reflection (Saturday)
7. Question (Sunday)

**Automation Tools I Use:**
- Cursor + Claude: Write variations
- n8n: Cross-post content
- Typefully: Thread scheduling
- Bannerbear: Auto-generate images

**Your Exercise:**
Set up ONE automation this week:
- Schedule a week of posts
- Create an email sequence
- Set up a reusable template

Start small. Even scheduling posts saves 30 mins/week.

Tomorrow: Turn followers into customers (ethically).

## Day 6: Monetization Methods
**Subject**: From free content to paid products (Day 6)
**Send**: 24 hours after Day 5

Hi [First Name],

"How do I monetize without being salesy?"

Most common question I get.

Here's my approach: **The Value Ladder**

```
Free Content (daily)
    ↓
Free Resource (weekly)
    ↓
Paid Product (monthly)
    ↓
Premium Service (quarterly)
```

**My Real Example:**
- Free: Daily Cursor tips on Twitter
- Resource: Cursor rules starter pack
- Product: Complete UI kit ($49)
- Premium: 1-on-1 consulting ($500/hr)

**The key**: Each level solves a bigger problem.

**Your Monetization Options:**

**Digital Products:**
- Templates/boilerplates
- Courses/tutorials
- Tools/plugins
- Notion templates

**Services:**
- Consulting
- Code reviews
- Building MVPs
- Teaching/workshops

**Your Exercise:**
Map your value ladder:
1. What do you give away free? (builds trust)
2. What's your first paid offer? (easy yes)
3. What's your dream offer? (premium value)

Remember: People pay for transformation, not information.

Final email tomorrow: Your 30-day action plan!
