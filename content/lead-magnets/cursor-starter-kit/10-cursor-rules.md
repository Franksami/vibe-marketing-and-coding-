## 9. The Git Commit Rule
```
For git commits:

## 💡 Pro Tip: Combining Rules

The real magic happens when you combine multiple rules. For example:
"Create a React component with tests and documentation"

This triggers rules 1, 2, and 6 simultaneously, saving even more time!

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Copy these rules into your Cursor settings
2. Customize them for your tech stack
3. Add your own rules as you discover patterns
4. Share your favorites with the community
