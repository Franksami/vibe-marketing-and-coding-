### Post 1: Welcome to Vibe Academy!
```
🚀 Welcome to Vibe Academy!

I'm thrilled to launch this community for developers and makers who want to build authentic tech brands using AI-powered tools.

Why I created Vibe Academy:
- Too much hype, not enough substance in the AI space
- Developers need real strategies, not just tutorials
- Building in public is powerful but needs structure
- AI tools are game-changers when used correctly

What we're about:
✅ Practical AI coding with Cursor & Claude
✅ Building real products that solve real problems
✅ Marketing that feels authentic, not salesy
✅ Supporting each other's journey

This is day 1. Let's build something amazing together!

Drop a 🚀 if you're excited to be here!

## 🔧 Tool Talk Channel

### Post 1: My Cursor + Claude Workflow
```
🔥 My Current Cursor + Claude Workflow

After months of iteration, here's my setup:

1. **Cursor Settings:**
   - Copilot++ enabled
   - Custom rules for each project type
   - Claude Opus for complex logic
   - GPT-4 for documentation

2. **Project Structure:**
   ```
   /.cursorrules      # Project-specific AI rules
   /src/
   /tests/            # AI helps write these
   /docs/             # AI-generated + reviewed
   ```

3. **My Process:**
   - Start with component spec in comments
   - Let Claude generate initial implementation
   - Refine with specific prompts
   - Always review and test

4. **Game-Changing Prompts:**
   - "Make this production-ready"
   - "Add error handling for edge cases"
   - "Generate tests for all functions"
   - "Optimize for performance"

### Post 2: n8n Automation Showcase
```
⚡ Just Built: Email to Notion to Slack Automation

Problem: Client emails getting lost, team not staying updated

Solution: n8n workflow that:
1. Monitors specific email label
2. Extracts key info using AI
3. Creates Notion task with details
4. Notifies team in Slack
5. Sends confirmation to client

Time saved: 2 hours/week
Time to build: 45 minutes

Here's the workflow: [Screenshot]

Key nodes used:
- Email Trigger (Gmail)
- OpenAI (extraction)
- Notion (create page)
- Slack (notification)
- Email (auto-reply)

### Post 2: AI Coding Checklist
```
✅ AI Coding Best Practices Checklist

Before letting AI touch your code:
□ Clear project structure defined
□ .cursorrules file created
□ Example patterns provided
□ Test cases outlined

During AI coding:
□ Review every suggestion
□ Test incrementally
□ Keep context focused
□ Use specific prompts

After AI generation:
□ Run all tests
□ Check for security issues
□ Verify error handling
□ Review for readability

Remember: AI is a tool, not a replacement for thinking!

Save this checklist for your next session.

## 💬 General Discussion

### Post 1: What Are You Building?
```
👋 Let's get to know each other!

I'll start: I'm building Vibe Academy to help developers create authentic tech brands using AI tools.

Current stack:
- Next.js 14 (app router)
- Supabase (auth + db)
- Cursor + Claude (development)
- n8n (automations)
- Stripe (payments)

Biggest challenge: Balancing community building with product development

Biggest win: This community launching!

Your turn - what are you building? What's your stack? What's challenging you right now?
```

### Post 2: Hot Take Thread
```
🔥 Hot Take: AI won't replace developers, but developers who don't use AI will be replaced by those who do.

Here's why:
- AI 10x's productivity on boilerplate
- More time for creative problem-solving
- Faster iteration = better products
- Learning curve is worth it

But also:
- You still need to understand the code
- AI makes mistakes (a lot)
- Architecture decisions are still human
- Debugging skills more important than ever

What's your hot take on AI in development?
