# Vibe Coding Academy - Curriculum Structure & Design

## Pedagogical Approach

### Core Learning Principles
1. **Learn by Building**: Every lesson produces working code/product
2. **AI-First Mindset**: Use AI as primary development tool
3. **Community Learning**: Peer collaboration and support
4. **Real-World Focus**: Build market-ready products
5. **Continuous Iteration**: Update skills as AI evolves

### Teaching Methodology
- **Microlearning**: 5-10 minute focused video lessons
- **Just-in-Time Learning**: Learn concepts as needed
- **Project-Based Assessment**: No traditional tests
- **Peer Review System**: Community feedback loop
- **Live Implementation**: Build alongside instructor
