   - Share in communities

4. **Schema Implementation on Revenue Pages**

### Deferred Tasks (Not Tomorrow)
- Task 13.7: Record Course Modules (can wait)
- Task 14: UI Kit testing (not revenue-generating)

- Any development not directly tied to sales

### Updated Priority Matrix

**Do Tomorrow:**
- ✅ Anything that directly generates revenue
- ✅ Domain and hosting setup
- ✅ Product uploads and sales pages
- ✅ Marketing and outreach
- ✅ SEO improvements (Schema)

**Skip Tomorrow:**
- ❌ Feature development

- ❌ Testing and documentation
- ❌ Nice-to-have improvements

### Success Metrics
- **Morning:** First sale before lunch
- **Afternoon:** 5+ sales
- **End of Day:** $235-$500 revenue
- **Week 1:** $1,000+ revenue

### Key Mindset
Every task should answer: "Does this help me make money TODAY?"

If no → Skip it
If yes → Do it immediately

Revenue first. Everything else second.
