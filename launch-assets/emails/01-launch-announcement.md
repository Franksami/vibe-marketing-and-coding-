Hey [First Name],

Quick update - I just launched something that's been helping me code insanely fast.

**The Ultimate Cursor Rulebook**: 50+ battle-tested rules that transform Cursor + Claude into your personal senior developer.

Here's what you get:
- 🎯 Framework-specific rules (React, Next.js, Vue, Node.js, Python)
- ⚡ Performance optimization rules
- 🏗️ Architecture and best practices
- 🛡️ Security-first development rules
- 🚀 SaaS development accelerators

**Launch price: $47** (going up to $97 next week)

The average developer saves 15-20 hours per week with these rules. At $100/hour, that's $1,500+ in value every week.

Best part? You can start using them in the next 5 minutes.

-[Your name]

P.S. This launch price is only available for the next 72 hours. After that, it jumps to $97.
