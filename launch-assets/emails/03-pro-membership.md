**Why Pro?**

The AI coding landscape changes FAST. New models, new features, new patterns every week.

Pro members get:
- Fresh rules for the latest AI updates
- Live coaching to implement them
- A community that's coding at the edge

One member saved 30 hours last month just from a single rule update I shared.

That's $3,000+ in value for $47.
