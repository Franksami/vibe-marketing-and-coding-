Hey [First Name],

Super quick note.

The Ultimate Cursor Rulebook launch price ends in 24 hours.

**Right now: $47**
**Tomorrow: $97**

That's a $50 jump.

If you've been thinking about it, now's the time:

[👉 Get It At Launch Price](https://gumroad.com/l/ultimate-cursor-rulebook)

Here's what you're getting:
- 50+ production-ready cursor rules
- Save 20+ hours every week
- Start using in 5 minutes
- Lifetime updates included

**Real talk:** I've sold 127 copies in 3 days. People are loving it.

But I promised the launch price would only last 72 hours, and I keep my promises.

Don't pay double tomorrow.

P.S. If you're reading this after midnight tomorrow, I'm sorry. The price is already $97. Should've grabbed it sooner! 🤷
