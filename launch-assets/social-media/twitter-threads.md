## Thread 2: Problem/Solution

```
Most developers using AI coding tools are leaving 80% of the power on the table.

Here's how to unlock Cursor's true potential: 🧵

1/ The Problem

You paste code, get suggestions, but:
• Generic outputs
• Inconsistent patterns
• Security vulnerabilities
• Performance issues
• Technical debt

You're using a Ferrari in first gear.

2/ The Solution: Custom Rules

.cursorrules files are like having a senior developer pair program with you 24/7.

They enforce:
• Your coding standards
• Framework best practices
• Security patterns
• Performance optimizations

3/ Example Rule That Saved Me 10 Hours

"Always use React.memo for components with 3+ props, implement proper dependency arrays, and add performance monitoring comments"

Result: 60% reduction in unnecessary re-renders.

4/ The Compound Effect

Week 1: Save 5 hours
Week 4: Save 20 hours
Month 3: Code 3x faster
Month 6: Senior-level patterns

It's not about typing faster.
It's about thinking less about HOW and more about WHAT.

5/ Get My Battle-Tested Rules

The Ultimate Cursor Rulebook:
• 50+ production-ready rules
• Framework-specific collections
• Performance optimizations
• Security best practices

$47 launch price: [LINK]

Your future self will thank you.

## Thread 3: Success Story

```
6 months ago: Junior dev struggling with deadlines

Today: $150/hour freelancer with a 3-month waitlist

Here's exactly how Jake did it with AI coding: 🧵

1/ The Starting Point

• 60+ hour weeks
• Missing deadlines
• Bugs in production
• Stressed and burned out
• Making $40/hour

Sound familiar?

2/ The Shift

Jake got the Ultimate Cursor Rulebook and implemented 5 rules:

• React performance patterns
• API error handling
• State management rules
• Testing requirements
• Code review checklist

3/ Week 1 Results

First project with rules:
• Expected: 3 weeks
• Delivered: 5 days
• Bugs: Zero
• Client reaction: "How?!"

He raised his rate to $75/hour immediately.

4/ Month 3 Progress

• 5 happy clients
• $100/hour rate
• 30-hour work weeks
• Zero stress
• Started teaching others

The rules became second nature.

5/ Today (Month 6)

• $150/hour
• 3-month waitlist
• 25-hour weeks
• $8K+ monthly
• Living his best life

All from better AI coding patterns.

6/ You Can Do This Too

## Thread 4: Tips & Value

```
10 Cursor + Claude tricks that will 10x your coding speed:

(The last one alone saved me 50 hours last month) 🧵

1/ Multi-File Context

Instead of explaining file relationships, use:
"Check @file1.ts and @file2.ts for context"

Claude understands the connections instantly.

2/ Performance Patterns

Add to .cursorrules:
"Always suggest performance optimizations for React components over 50 lines"

Never ship slow code again.

3/ Error Prevention

Rule: "For every function, suggest error handling and edge cases"

Catches bugs before they exist.

4/ Type Safety

"Enforce strict TypeScript types, never use 'any'"

Your future self says thanks.

5/ Code Reviews

"After each implementation, provide a security and performance review"

Like having a senior dev on call.

6/ Documentation

"Generate JSDoc comments for all exported functions"

Self-documenting code.

7/ Testing

"Suggest unit tests for all business logic"

100% coverage becomes easy.

8/ Refactoring

"Identify code smells and suggest refactors"

Clean code by default.

9/ Architecture

"Enforce SOLID principles and clean architecture"

Scalable from day 1.

10/ The Game Changer

Combine ALL these into rule collections.

That's what the Ultimate Cursor Rulebook is.
