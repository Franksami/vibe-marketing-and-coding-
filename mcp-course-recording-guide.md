## 📹 Recording Workflow

### Step 1: Review the Script
- Read through the entire script once
- Practice tricky technical terms
- Note where you'll need to switch screens
- Have water nearby

### Step 2: Set Up Your Screens
```
Monitor 1: Recording software + Script
Monitor 2: Browser/Terminal/Claude Code (what you're recording)
```

If single monitor:
- Print script or use phone/tablet
- Use Alt+Tab to check script between sections

### Step 3: Record in Segments
Instead of one 15-minute take, record in sections:
1. **Intro** (1 min) - Get energy up!
2. **Concept explanation** (3 min) - Can use slides
3. **n8n setup** (5 min) - Go slow here
4. **Claude setup** (3 min) - Show file creation
5. **Testing** (2 min) - Include celebration!
6. **Outro** (1 min) - Call to action

### Step 4: Basic Editing
Minimal editing needed:
- Remove long pauses ("umms")
- Speed up typing sequences 
- Add zoom on small text
- Insert Module title card at start

## 🚀 Publishing Workflow

### Option A: Direct to Skool (Recommended for Now)

1. **Export your video** as MP4 (1080p)

2. **Log into Skool** at skool.com/vibe-coding

3. **Navigate to course area**:
   ```
   Classroom > Vibe Coding Masterclass > Add Module
   ```

4. **Create module structure**:
   ```
   Section: MCP Marketing Course
   └── Module 1: MCP Server Setup (15 min)
       ├── Video: Main lesson
       ├── Resource: workflow JSON file
       ├── Resource: Troubleshooting PDF
       └── Assignment: Share #Module1Done
   ```

5. **Upload settings**:
   - Title: "Module 1: MCP Server Setup"
   - Description: Copy from script intro
   - Visibility: Vibe Coder ($49 tier)
   - Enable comments: Yes
   - Enable completion tracking: Yes

6. **Add resources**:
   - Upload the n8n workflow JSON
   - Link to this recording guide
   - Add "Get Help" link to community chat

### Option B: Automated Publishing (Future Setup)

We can build an n8n workflow that:
1. Watches Google Drive folder for new videos
2. Automatically uploads to Skool via API
3. Creates module structure
4. Notifies students
5. Posts in community

**Want this?** Let's build it after recording 2-3 modules manually first.

## 🤔 Common Questions

**Q: Should I show my face on camera?**
A: Yes for intro/outro, optional for technical parts. Students connect better with faces.

**Q: What if I make mistakes while recording?**
A: Keep going! Say "Actually, let me show you the right way..." - Students learn from mistakes.

**Q: How perfect should the edit be?**
A: Don't over-edit. Authentic > Perfect. Remove major errors and long pauses only.

**Q: Should I create slides?**
A: Only for the concept section (API vs MCP). Rest should be live demos.

**Q: What about closed captions?**
A: Skool auto-generates them. Review and fix technical terms after upload.
